### What is this

A Faust reverb, based on the architecture described [here](https://valhalladsp.com/2010/08/25/rip-keith-barr/).

### Where can I find more information

See [blog.reverberate.ca](blog.reverberate.ca) for a more detailed description.

### Build instructions

Run:
$> make

The build folder will contain the result of the build process. Note you may need to copy or simlink SDK header files to /usr/local/include (e.g., for Max/MSP and supercollider) to get this to work

I have only tested this on OS X Yosemite. You can find some precompiled binaries [here](https://github.com/coreyker/KBVerb/releases/latest).
